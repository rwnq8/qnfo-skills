### Programmatic Loading & Execution
This skill is loaded and executed **programmatically by the LLM system** 
during response generation. Loading is triggered automatically via 
`skill_view('memory-management')` or `read()` with filesystem path.
**The user NEVER manually loads this skill.** The `skill-autoloader` 
detects task patterns and handles all skill loading. If this skill fails 
to load, the LLM system automatically retries via the fallback chain 
documented below.
**Pinning:** This skill is [On-demand — loads when triggered by task patterns].

### Skill Loading Retry Protocol
If `skill_view('name')` fails during programmatic loading, the LLM system 
MUST execute this fallback chain:
1. **Retry 1:** `read('%USERPROFILE%\.deepchat\skills\<name>\SKILL.md')`
2. **Retry 2:** Pull from Cloudflare R2: `npx wrangler r2 object get 
   qnfo/prompts/skills/<name>/SKILL.md --remote --file=_skill.md`
3. **Retry 3:** If R2 fails, search local filesystem for any cached copy
4. **Fallback:** If ALL retries fail, continue with `[SKILL-UNAVAILABLE: <name>]` 
   and best-effort knowledge
**NEVER silently proceed without a skill's critical instructions.** If a skill 
is required for the task and cannot be loaded after 3 retries, escalate to 
the user with the specific failure reason.

# Memory Management

Use this skill when a task may produce durable learning or when the user asks you to recall, remember, continue earlier work, preserve an exact statement, capture a reusable procedure, or handle a recurring need.

## Recall

Rely on automatic memory injection for ordinary context. Use `memory_recall` when the user refers to previous work with cues such as again, last time, before, continue, same project, remember, or asks what you already know.

Use `tape_search` and then `tape_context` when the user needs source evidence, exact wording, logs, command output, file snippets, or why a prior decision was made. Memory is a durable conclusion layer, not the raw transcript.

## Remember

Use `memory_remember` only for durable conclusions that should change future behavior. Choose the most specific category:

- `user_preference`: stable user preferences, constraints, communication style, environment choices.
- `project_fact`: durable project conventions, architecture entry points, commands, dependencies, paths, or operational constraints.
- `task_outcome`: completed, blocked, or deliberately deferred task results. Include status, outcome, and blocker in prose when relevant.
- `heuristic`: reusable troubleshooting strategy, workflow, decision rule, or engineering lesson.
- `anti_pattern`: repeated mistake, unsafe approach, brittle pattern, stale assumption, or thing to avoid.

Do not remember raw tool results, bash output, grep output, file contents, transient mechanics, one-off failures, secrets, credentials, hidden reasoning, or anything only useful for the current turn.

## Verbatim Scope

Store exact wording only when the user explicitly asks you to remember a sentence or phrase verbatim. In that case, keep the requested text intact and make the surrounding content minimal.

Automatic extraction is different: it should normalize durable facts into concise memory content, deduplicate related entries, and avoid preserving raw transcript text.

## Procedures -> Skill

When the useful learning is a reusable multi-step procedure, prefer drafting a skill with `skill_manage` instead of stuffing the full procedure into Memory. Memory may keep a short pointer or heuristic, but the repeatable workflow belongs in a Skill.

Use `skill_manage` for draft skills only. Do not modify installed skills unless the user explicitly asks through the supported review flow.

## Recurring -> Scheduled Task

When the user asks for a periodic, low-frequency, or future recurring action, suggest creating a Scheduled Task in settings. Memory does not wake the agent, schedule future work, or create automation side effects.

## End-of-task Learning Check

Before finishing a non-trivial task, check whether there is one durable lesson to save:

1. Did the user reveal a stable preference or constraint?
2. Did you learn a durable project fact?
3. Is there a task outcome, blocker, or explicit deferral worth preserving?
4. Did a reusable heuristic work?
5. Did an anti-pattern or stale assumption become clear?
6. Is this actually a reusable procedure for `skill_manage` or a recurring need for Scheduled Tasks rather than Memory?

Remember only the smallest durable conclusion. Leave raw process in Tape.
